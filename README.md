# CCAfrica-BackEnd
The project for a non-profit organization

For Cham and Chenyu,

This is first steps of the back-end development. I just tried to code individual function the website should have. The links between functions at this step may not clear.
Once I have design layout and when I code for the front-end part, I will integrate this part along with front-end part and the routes between functions and pages will make sense more.
